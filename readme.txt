=========

Appends a WordPress Role to each user's account during checkout where the role uses the Membership Level as it's displayed name.

== Description ==
This plugin provides role support for Paid Memberships Pro. The basic plugin will add/remove level specific role(s)
as/when the user purchases a membership level. This can be used together with 3rd party plugins to manage navigation
menu visibility, etc.

*Unlike the original PMPro Roles add-on, this plugin will not be disruptive to previously assigned membership
role(s) for members/users of your service*

The plugin requires the free Membership plugin (Paid Memberships Pro)[https://www.paidmembershipspro.com].

Any enabled add-on modules for this plugin will require whatever plugin or functionality they support/list as required.

The plugin currently supports the following add-on modules:

* Level Capabilities - Allows the admin to assign specific WordPress capabilities to a membership level.
* bbPress Forum - Use the "Require Membership" forum protection settings, together with membership level specific role permissions to determine the level of access a member can have to any given forum or topic. In other words, you can configure a membership level to grant the member:
* 1. No access
* 1. Read Only access
* 1. Add reply access
* 1. Add Topic access
* 1. Support access
* 1. Admin access

You can also grant read-only access to all forums (both membership protected and not) for any user/entity, even when not logged in.

These add-on modules can be licensed & activated by purchasing the add-on use license at (the Eighty / 20 Results website)[link="https://eighty20results.com/wordpress-plugins/e20r-roles-licenses"]

Requires the bbPress Forum plugin if you enable the bbPress Roles module.
Requires the BuddyPress plugin if you enable the BuddyPress Roles module (Not yet available)

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `e20r-roles-for-pmpro` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory of your site.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
1. That's it. Settings are managed through the "Settings" -> "E20R Roles for PMPro" options/settings page.
