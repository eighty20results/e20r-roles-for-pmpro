The individual modules/add-ons can then be enabled on the local server via the \"Settings\" page for \"E20R Roles for PMPro\"</p><p>The bbPress Roles add-on/module requires the bbPress Forum plugin.</p><p>The BuddyPress plugin is required if you enable the BuddyPress Roles module (Not yet available)</p>",
